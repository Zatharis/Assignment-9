                    This is a tracker from when I followed a DIY project. They managed to last the exact 
                    2 years I needed them to before they all fried. I like this work because I love tinkering 
                    with things.

                <p>
                    This is a keyboard I put together. It was actually a pretty good experience. As with the 
                    other one, I love tinkering and so I tinkered until I found a switch layout and sound I 
                    liked from this keyboard. Its soft but with some resistance, it also <q>thocks</q>.

                    This is one of the models I have textured. I also find texturing models very meditative.
